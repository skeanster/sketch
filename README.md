# Etch-a-sketch

This was my first complex Javascript project.

What challenged me: this was the first time using loops in a project, and while I didn't exactly find loops to be that challenging to pick up, combining loops with DOM manipulation was not easy at all for me. Though, after some time I eventually got the hang of it and finished off my etch-a-sketch project. I am quite proud of this one. Every once in a while I even open it up in a new tab and draw something just for fun when I need a break from work.


Enjoy!
